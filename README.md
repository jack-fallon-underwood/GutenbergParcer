# Gutenberg Parser and Markov Text Generator

## Overview
This project implements a Markov chain text generator that analyzes a collection of text files (such as those from Project Gutenberg) to generate new text based on the probabilities of word sequences. The program reads text files, builds a database of word transitions, and generates text by selecting words based on their probabilities.

## Features
- **Database Management**: Uses SQLite to store word transition probabilities.
- **Text Parsing**: Reads text files and ZIP archives, processing them to extract word pairs.
- **Text Generation**: Generates new text based on the trained word probabilities.

## Requirements
- .NET 7.0 or later
- Microsoft.Data.Sqlite package

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jack-fallon-underwood/GutenbergParcer.git

2. dotnet restore
